# Customer_Analysis
Customer Personality Analysis and Customer Segmentation using EDA and Clustering Techniques.

Dataset Description: 

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a companyâ€™s ideal customers. 
It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

The Task: 

Use EDA and Machine Learning Techniques to perform Customer Segmentation and help the company better understands its customers.

The Solution Process:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: includes removing unnecessary columns, feature Engineering, Data Manipulation and using Visualization to perform EDA.
- Dimensionality Reduction: using PCA "Principal Component Analysis".
- Clustering: using K-Means Clustering, Hierarchal Clustering and using calinski_harabasz_score, silhouette_score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Data Visualization: used to evaluate the characteristics of the customers in the different clusters found the group.

The Findings:

customers were divided into 4 segments:
1. segment 1 (yellow): low spenders, undergraduate students with no kids, the least number of customers, low income.
2. segment 2 (blue): low spenders, postgraduates with either no kids or 2 kids, the largest number of customers, average income.
3. segment 3 (black): max spenders, postgraduates with either no kids or 1 kid, high income.
4. segment 4 (green): average spenders, undergraduates and postgraduates with 1 kid, average income.
